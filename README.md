# snim-project
i'm currently working on some updates 
switching from classic SQL to Sequelize for this reason the latest commit don't work 
if you're intrested in this project and you want to run it localy i sugget that you download the init commit.
hopefully the final product will be ready in this week with the Docker image so you can test it easly.
so as they say stay tuned ;)
